//Log of bugs and future updates

- Fix bugs:
  1. Can't shoot interior points of last ship in fleet
    a. Could be that ship doesn't contain these points
    b. Could be that member function of ship isn't properly tracking shots fired at these points

- Replace pointers of dynamically allocated objects w/ smart pointers
- Include header files: time.h, stdio.h, stdlib.h, time.h
